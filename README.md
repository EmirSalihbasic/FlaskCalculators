# FlaskCalculators
In this Repository I am creating different types of calculators using Flask. 
For every calculator there will be one directory.

On the list I have:

1.CalculatorWithErorrMessage (this is simple calculator that is showing error message when we trying to execute some operations which ore not possible to execute, for example, to divide with zero)

2.Black-Scholes Model calculator (this is the simple calculator for the most famous finance formula of all time)
